                        No one wants to lose money and celebrate it. But embracing failure is an important part of innovation. No company seeks failure for its own sake, but it is important to recognize that every failure offers valuable lessons for future efforts. In the words
                        of Thomas Edison, “I have not failed. I have only found 10,000 ways that have not worked.” And Edison’s light bulb was not a one-time stroke of genius that could simply be planned, but the result of constant experimentation and
                        learning from mistakes until it finally worked. If a KPI had been set, it would have been ready after 100 experiments. However, it is not enough to allow failures. The company must develop a culture that not only tolerates failure,
                        but actively encourages it. This includes ensuring that failure is no longer perceived as a setback but as an opportunity to learn. It is also about creating an environment in which employees feel safe to take risks and make mistakes.
